Degas made many drawings of dancers in this pose. The earliest was probably drawn around 1879, and relates to a painting entitled The Dance Lesson (c.1880, Sterling and Francine Clerk Institute, Williamstown, Mass.), one of the first ballet scenes for which Degas adopted an extended horizontal compositional format. This drawing is thought to date from the same period, however, the position of the dancer’s head, leg and tutu relate more closely to another composition in a similar format, now in Yale University Art Gallery, which Degas painted at least five years later.
