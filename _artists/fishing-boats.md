An enthusiastic sailor, Signac was familiar with much of the French coastline, and, from the late 1880s, many of his paintings and watercolours depict ports and vessels
in full sail or at anchor.

He was largely self-taught as a painter in oils and went on to develop a highly personal watercolour style, based on Pissarro’s initial advice, and on the example of his three touchstones, the ‘idealist’ Turner, ‘the realist’, Jongkind and ‘the analyst’, Cézanne.
