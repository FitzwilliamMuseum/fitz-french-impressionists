This landscape was painted in 1873, when Gauguin was still working as a stockbroker, and painting in his spare time. He first sent his work to public exhibitions in 1876, and in 1879 accepted Pissarro’s and Degas's last-minute offer to contribute to the fourth Impressionist exhibition.

In tonality and composition, it recalls landscapes by Corot, however the elongated canvas (a non-standard format) and deep perspectival recession following the lines of the fields, closely recall a landscape by Pissarro, one of a series representing the seasons which Gauguin’s godfather, Gustave Arosa, commissioned the previous year.
