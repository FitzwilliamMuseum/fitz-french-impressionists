Cézanne began to paint landscapes in the early 1870s, working in Marseilles and later at Pontoise and Auvers.

This landscape was once thought to have been painted between 1882 and 1885, but a significantly later dating of around 1900-1904 has now become widely accepted, since around this date, Cézanne used overlapping brushstrokes extensively in other paintings, influenced by his experience of working in watercolour.
The precise location remains uncertain.
