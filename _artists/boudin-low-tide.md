Portrieux (now Saint-Quay-Portrieux), in the bay of St. Brieuc, Côtes du Nord,
was a popular village with painters. Boudin visited it on several of his trips to
Brittany between 1865 and 1897; the signature and date at the lower right indicate
that this view was painted in 1873.

As the son of a ship’s captain, who had worked as a cabin boy on ships plying the
Channel coast, Boudin was perfectly placed to recognise, and record, the individual
characteristics of the vessels he came across in the ports he visited; in Portrieux,
he focused particularly on the fishing vessels from Newfoundland, the Terre-Neuvas,
becalmed at low tide, and painted at least six works on this theme.
